**Name of Asset**:  
Avnet Web and Mobile Design System
 
**Description**:  
A majority of today's web, mobile, or hybrid application projects do not take a holistic approach to strategy, design, development, performance, scalability, and/or maintainability.

The following are a few key facets of a centralized design system:

* customers will have the ability to plug into as little or as much of the system as needed to support their brand and effort.
* customers will be delivered a system that has scalability into future projects with minimal effort or refactoring.
* designers and developers will have a centralized system that greatly increases development time and reduces time to market.

* define a modular and scalable development process which can support all levels of a projects complexity.
* outline design patterns and organization that allow customers support a wide range of efforts from marketing campaigns, mobile designs, to internal company systems.
* develop a set of standardized code conventions and element definitions in order to speed development and reduce errors.
* build a set of globalized tools and resources that allow the design system to be used across a variety of projects.
